# TypeScript Cloud Functions

This is a repository holding a codebase with many standard Cloud Functions any CrossPlatform app would require (ex. registering a user, authenticating a user, along with more specific processes like processing a post a user might make.), On top of that it includes standardized chron-jobs that are used to perform mass actions on multiple users on the database (for this codebase Firebase is used as a database).
